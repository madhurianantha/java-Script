<h3>Books written by billy grham</h3>
<p><b> BILLY GRAHAM</b> wrote a total of 33 books, including many best-sellers and autobiographies, and many of his earlier works have been updated and reissued throughout the years.
 Here's a look at the highlights of his<i> 70-year publishing</i> career:<br>
One of his first books, Peace With God, was published by Doubleday in 1953 and has sold over 2 million copies in 38 languages.
It was revised and expanded multiple times including editions in 1984, 2000, and 2017.<br>
His 1955 book, Freedom From the Seven Deadly Sins; The Secret Of Happiness was revised and expanded in 1985.<br>
The 1965 book World Aflame was a New York Times and Times Magazine best-seller.<br>
The Jesus Generation published in 1971 sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks after publication.
 This has not been reissued, <del>most likely because the content is dated</del>, but if you can find a copy of the 1971 book it has the most amazing artwork on the cover.</p>
